# **Hard Performance Measurement (MSS)**

## Chapter 1.Introduction Problem description background of the algorithms

与先前研究过的最大子列和问题相类似，本次project要研究的问题是关于一个升维的问题，即最大子矩阵和（MaxSubMatrix）

问题中会实现给定一个$N\times N$的由整数组成的矩阵 $(a_{ij})_{N\times N}$, our task is to find the maximum value of 

$\sum_{k=i}^m\sum_{l=j}^na_{kl}$ ,where $a_{kl}$ could be negative,positive or zero.

for all $1\le i≤m≤ N$ and $1≤j≤n≤N$. 

For convenience, the maximum submatrix sum is 0 if all the integers are negative.

## Chapter 2: Algorithm Specification Description (pseudo-code preferred) of all the algorithms involved for solving the problem, including specifications of main data structures. 



## Chapter 3: Testing Results Table of test cases. 

Each test case usually consists of a brief description of the purpose of this case, the expected result, the actual behavior of your program, the possible cause of a bug if your program does not function as expected, and the current status (“pass”, or “corrected”, or “pending”). 

## Chapter 4: Time and space complexities analysis

Comments on further possible improvements. Appendix: Source Code (in C) At least 30% of the lines must be commented. Otherwise the code will NOT be evaluated.
