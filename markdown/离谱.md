we demonstrated that by considering jointly the hand and the object and by modeling occlusions and physical con- straints it is possible to better understand aspects of both. More specifically, the optimization over the parameters of a joint hand-object 3D model results in full hand pose estima- tion that is performed more accurately compared to meth- ods that consider the hand in isolation. On top of that, a parametric expression of the manipulated object is also computed. PSO is proved very competent in handling the complex, multidimensional and multimodal objective func- tion of this problem. Results from extensive experiments on simulated data demonstrated the potential of the method against ground truth, but also comparatively to the results of a state-of-the-art hand pose estimation method that consid- ers hands in isolation. Experiments in real world sequences exhibit that the proposed method performs well in chal- lenging cases of complex hand articulation and hand-object interaction. Ongoing research investigates the potential of HOPE in supporting the interpretation of the semantics of human grasping and manipulation activities.
